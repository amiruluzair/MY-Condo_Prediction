*Malaysian Condo Market Predictions and Analysis using Web-Scraped Data*

This project focuses on predicting the prices of condominiums in Malaysia using a dataset of over 4,000 listings scraped from the housing website mudah.my. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately estimate property prices based on features such as property size, location, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, nearby amenities (schools, parks, malls, etc.), and other relevant attributes.

The dataset provides raw, unstructured data, offering a valuable opportunity to apply data cleaning and preprocessing techniques. This includes handling missing values, parsing textual descriptions, standardizing categorical variables, and engineering new features to improve model performance.

The project mirrors the analytical frameworks of popular competitions like the House Prices Starter Competition and the Melbourne Housing Dataset, but with a unique focus on Malaysia's real estate market. It involves:

Data cleaning and transformation.
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights and trends.
Feature selection and engineering to enhance predictive accuracy.
Model building using regression techniques to predict prices.
Model evaluation and fine-tuning for optimal results.
The project showcases practical applications of data science and machine learning in real estate, offering insights into Malaysia's housing market while providing hands-on experience with complex datasets.
